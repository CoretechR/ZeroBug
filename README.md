# ZeroBug - DIY Hexapod Robot

Zerobug is a 3D-printed micro-servo hexapod robot powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero and a STM32F103. The Pi Zero is in charge of the input methods and front end, making the robot controllable via mouse, keyboard, multitouch or simply a Bluetooth Gamepad. To get the robot walking, the STM32 handles leg locomotion, inverse kinematics and controls its 18 servos.
